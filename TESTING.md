## Code Validation
- #### HTML was validated using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/). The validator gives a warning if you do not use h2-h6 in a section tag, the design of the site did not warrent the use of these tags so I have left these warning in the final version, the duplicate IDs are left in as they are used for the active links - The results can be found here:
